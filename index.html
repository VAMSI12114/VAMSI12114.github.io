          children and their families every year, through more than 400 live welfare

          Education is both the means as well as the end to a better life: the means
          because it empowers an individual to earn his/her livelihood and the end
          because it increases one's awareness on a range of issues – from healthcare
          to appropriate social behaviour to understanding one's rights – and in the
          process help him/her evolve as a better citizen.

      <p>
        It is the mental pain caused by stress from years and years of being
        neglected, pushed aside, disregarded, unloved, and made to feel
        undeserving, and in almost all cases, made to feel like a possession
        rather than an equal human being.
